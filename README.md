## 🧠 About Me
I'm a security-focused developer who works across low-level systems, backend services, and full-stack applications.  
My background spans:

- ⚔️ Red team operations & adversary simulation (authorized environments only)
- 🧵 Systems programming in **C, C++, Rust**
- 🐍 Rapid tooling & automation in **Python**
- 🌐 Full-stack development (front-end + back-end)
- 🛠️ Designing and experimenting with cross-platform security tools
- 🧪 Building and testing my own research language: **Red Lang**

I focus heavily on detection engineering, bypass research, and building secure, reproducible tooling for legitimate red-team and defensive studies.
